# Jobs Tracker 

A jobs tracker application built with vanilla `Web Components` as frontend and `Node.js` as backend.

## Motivation.

I have been hunting for new remote front-end developer jobs for the last few months. As a developer I hate to keep track of the companies that I have applied with Excel, so I create this jobs tracker to improve the whole experience. This project is intended to run locally.

This is a refactoring of another project of mine (private repo) which is built with `Web Components` as frontend and `PHP` as backend with `AWS DynamoDB`.

## Tech Stack

- Web Components
- [Cucumber Components](https://github.com/heybran/cucumber-components)
- Nojde.js/Express.js
- XATA Database (https://xata.io/)
